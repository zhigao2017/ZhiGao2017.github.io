## Education
I received the B.S. degree in computer science from the Beijing Institute of Technology (BIT), Beijing, China, in 2017. 

I am currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree with the Beijing Laboratory of Intelligent Information Technology under the supervision of Prof. Yuwei Wu and Prof. Yunde Jia. 

## Research Interest
My research interests lie in computer vision and machine learning. Concretely, 

(1) I am interested in the **structure and geometry of data space**. In my graduate studies, I work on learning representations on Riemannian manifolds to match some properties of data. 

(2) I am interested in **knowledge** mining, representation, and reasoning in machine learning, which make algorithms more robust, interpretable, and trustworthy. 

(3) I am interested in machine learning in the **open environment** where insufficient annotation is provided and there is distribution shift between data, such as few-shot learning, meta-learning, self-supervised learning, and continual learning.
