Introduce our MAT project. It provides an agent tuning framework, a dataset, and a T3-agent. The framework automatically generates multimodal trajectories for tool usage. Based on the framework, we obtain the MM-Traj dataset, having 20K trajectory data. Finally, we use the dataset to tune MiniCPM and Qwen-VL, and obtain the T3-agent.

It shows a efficient way to enhance the tool usage ability of multimodal agents.
